Contents:

* formats/ : the data type definitions for verifier log entries and
  their parsers and serializers.

* ...


Usage:

`make` will automatically build two static libraries:

* formats/dist/veritasformats.a: the formally verified parsers and
  serializers for verifier log entries

* dist/libveritascore.a: the rest of the formally verified
  implementation of Veritas.

To build a Veritas application (e.g. test/), just link it with those
two static libraries AND EverCrypt
(hacl/dist/gcc-compatible/libevercrypt.a)
