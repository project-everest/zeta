Contents:

* formats/ : the data type definitions for verifier log entries and
  their parsers and serializers.

* ...


Dependencies:

The only needed dependencies are F* and Kremlin. Point the FSTAR_HOME
(resp. KREMLIN_HOME) to the root directory of the F* (resp. Kremlin)
source tree.

* HACL* is attached as a submodule (in hacl-star/) used only to
  recompile EverCrypt from a C snapshot there, but not for
  verification or compilation of Veritas.

* EverParse is not needed. formats/dist/ contains a C snapshot of the
  formally verified parsers and serializers, that can be compiled
  without EverParse. EverParse is needed only to regenerate that
  snapshot, and is not needed in the verification or compilation of
  the rest of Veritas.


Usage:

`make` will automatically build three static libraries:

* formats/dist/veritasformats.a: the formally verified parsers and
  serializers for verifier log entries

* dist/libveritascore.a: the rest of the formally verified
  implementation of Veritas.

* hacl-star/dist/gcc-compatible/libevercrypt.a: the EverCrypt formally
  verified cryptographic library. This library is compiled from a C
  snapshot already existing in hacl-star/dist/, so no reverification
  is performed here.

To build a Veritas application (e.g. test/), just link it with those
three static libraries.
