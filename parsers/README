This directory is to automatically generate parsers and serializers
for verifier logs.

VeritasFormats.rfc contains a semi-formal description of the wire
format as data types following RFC-style format descriptions
(e.g. TLS)

0. Prerequisites

Clone github.com/FStarLang/FStar set the FSTAR_HOME variable to
point to the F* directory, then run `make` there.

Clone github.com/FStarLang/kremlin and set the KREMLIN_HOME variable
to point to the KreMLin directory, then run `make` there.

Clone github.com/project-everest/everparse and set the QD_HOME
variable to point to the EverParse directory, then run `make` there.

1. How to build

Just run `make`.

Then, EverParse automatically produces *.fsti files containing F* data
types corresponding to the data types described in VeritasFormats.rfc,
and declarations of their parser specifications (*_parser) and
serializer specifications (*_serializer) and their high-level
functional implementations (*_parser32, *_serializer32). EverParse
also automatically generates their definitions in *.fst files.

Then, F* extracts them to OCaml in extracted/, and ocamlopt compiles
them.
