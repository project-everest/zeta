1. A new hacl* distro in hacl-star-8*

   in gcc-compatible, do
     1. ./configure

     2. make

        This should give you libevercrypt.so
        
        with both EverCrypt_AEAD implemented using AES-NI in assembly
        and Hacl_Hash_Blake2b_256, implemented in C using AVX2

        You need to link libevercrypt.so with the Zeta_Steel_SafeMain

     3. I wrote a little utility wrapper around EverCrypt to check
        if the CPU supports AES-NI and AVX2

        in hacl-star-8*/gcc-compatible, see CheckCPU.c
        To build and run it do:

         `make CheckCPU`

2. The new Zeta_Steel_SafeMain.c has some externs

    1. +EverCrypt_AEAD_encrypt_expand_aes128_gcm_no_check (which
        should come from EverCrypt_AEAD.h)
        
    2. +Hacl_Hash_Blake2b_256_blake2b .. from hacl above

    3. +extern uint8_t *Zeta_Steel_Globals_aead_key_buffer

       A 16 bytes AEAD Key

    4. We also have externs for the parser/serializer functions, but
       these should already be there in ZetaFormats.h (resolved at
       link time)
