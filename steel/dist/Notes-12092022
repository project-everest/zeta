1. A new hacl* distro in hacl-star-8*

   in gcc-compatible, do
     1. ./configure
     2. make EverCrypt_AEAD.o (needs AES-NI)
     3. make Hacl_Hash_Blake2b_256.o (needs AVX2)
     4. To check if a machine has these instructions,
        you can also build `make EverCrypt_AutoConfig2.o`

2. The new Zeta_Steel_SafeMain.c has some externs

    1. +EverCrypt_AEAD_encrypt_expand_aes128_gcm_no_check (which
        should come from EverCrypt_AEAD.h)
        
    2. +Hacl_Hash_Blake2b_256_blake2b .. from hacl above

    3. +extern uint8_t *Zeta_Steel_Globals_aead_key_buffer

       A 16 bytes AEAD Key

    4. We also have externs for the parser/serializer functions, but
       these should already be there in ZetaFormats.h (resolved at
       link time)
